> Read the Unified System Logs for the following:
MDM Client Process for the last 24 hours in info and debug mode
/usr/bin/log show --predicate "process='mdmclient'" --last 24h --info --debug
If for the last 24 hours, there has been any logged error about Unable to create MDM identity, we consider the MDM identity itself to have possible issues.

> Managed Client logs
/usr/bin/log show --style syslog --predicate "process='mdmclient' or subsystem='com.apple.ManagedClient'"
If the very last response we have received from the device is a message containing “Processing server request” and “OSUpdate,” we assume that the OS Updates process is the last action that is stuck.

> MDM Client Process for the last 90 minutes
/usr/bin/log show --predicate "process='mdmclient'" --last 90m
Here we are looking for a received response for an MDM command with a status 200 for the HTTP communication in the last 90 minutes. If we do not get that response, MDM is determined to be stuck and the remediation in number 2 of this workflow takes place.
